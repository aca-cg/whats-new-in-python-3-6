# PEP 498: Formatted string literals

[PEP 498](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498) introduces a new kind of string literals: *f-strings*, or [formatted string literals](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings).

Formatted string literals are prefixed with `'f'` and are similar to the format strings accepted by [str.format()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format). They contain replacement fields surrounded by curly braces. The replacement fields are expressions, which are evaluated at run time, and then formatted using the [format()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#format) protocol:

```python
>>> name = "Fred"
>>> f"He said his name is {name}."
'He said his name is Fred.'
>>> width = 10
>>> precision = 4
>>> value = decimal.Decimal("12.34567")
>>> f"result: {value:{width}.{precision}}"  # nested fields
'result:      12.35'
```
